# DTC Route Information: Online information about the bus routes and their frequency and fares
# SOURCE OF INFORMATION FROM dtc, dELHI
# You can also use the DTC API to get the bus routes and fares, However, you need to register and get an API key.
# Please note that this is a very basic example, and you will likely need to add more code to handle errors, pagination, 
# and other features that are specific to your project.



import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# define the URL of the DTC website
url = "https://delhi.gov.in/wps/wcm/connect/doit_transport/Transport/Home/Bus+Services/Bus+Timings"

# make a GET request to the website
response = requests.get(url)

# parse the HTML content of the website using BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

# find all the elements with the class "bus-timing-table"
bus_timings_table = soup.find_all(class_='bus-timing-table')

# loop through each table and print the bus route and frequency
